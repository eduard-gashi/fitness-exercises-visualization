## Project Overview

This project presents a visual interface that allows users to explore various fitness exercises, ranked by a custom Hypertrophy Score. This score is calculated using scientifically relevant metrics including EMG activation and Stimulus-to-Fatigue Ratio (SFR). It also incorporates whether the exercise provides a deep loaded stretch — a key factor for muscle hypertrophy — as well as user ratings sourced from members of Bodybuilding.com.
- Hover and click bars to explore exercises by muscle group and view detailed information about each exercise
- Click on x-axis labels to drill down into a specific muscle group and see more exercises related to it
- Hold Ctrl (or ⌘ on Mac) and click to select and compare two exercises side by side
- Filter exercises by equipment type using the sidebar
- Choose how many top exercises to display per muscle group with a dropdown selector
